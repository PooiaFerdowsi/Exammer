Project 'Exammer'
==============

The word 'exammer'
------------------
The word 'exammer' is a constructed word and I assume even if such a word exists in a dictionary, it doesn't mean what I meant.

The word is consists of two parts, 'Exam' and the suffix '-er'.
As you probably know 'exam' means 'test' & '-er' indicates the doer [of an action].

So I think 'exammer' means who give you a quiz. Maybe your teacher.


What is it?!
-----------
didn't you know?! As you probably didn't know I'll explain what it is!

This project is a very basic project to show you how your school's site quizzes work. And as you guessed before, to teach me how to implement one.

If you didn't get the point this project is a simple quiz app for web. Just as your school has one. Doesn't the school have one? but mine does!

Also, notice that it's different from what you expected because it's a *very* __simple__ implementation.

What can I do with it?
-----------------------
If you be the server or client, no difference is made!
so anything a server can do, a client can do.

didn't I answer the main question? Yep!
You can:
* Insert a new question
* * Your question must have a title
* * The question must have four selections
* * And must have only one correct answer, not more or less
* Delete a/some question/questions
* view and answer a question
And there is no 'editability. but it's in the [TODO](TODO) list currently!

The application contains API too! but the API is not good enough, unfortunately.
Though the API is ready to use, fortunately!

Can I help
----------
Your help is the greatest idea for me! but:

### How can I help?
Your help can be any type of help mentioned below!!

#### Improving my ugly code -------
No code is problemless. help me to fix the mistakes I have made.
Search for hidden mistakes to my eyes. Your eyes are the founders!
Then If you could fix it & request a pull! otherwise, mention and notice me.

#### accomplishing the TODO list
Nothing is perfect. even 'nothing' is not perfect.
But each stage is a step forward.
Go forward! Don't leap backward!
If you can't be perfect it doesn't mean to give up instead it means to try to advance!

These advancements are in the TODO list. Do what the above chapter did! [improving my ugly code]

#### Help with use!
If you use it you are helping me and I'll thank you!

#### Help with launch [the rocket]
It's much like _Help with use_ but differs a bit
help with use is personal while it's public.

In this case, you launch this app on your site for a purpose
or use it as a sidely app or any other type of use.

#### Help with introduction
Tell about this project to other people to raise the number of users of the app.

I want to use it!
